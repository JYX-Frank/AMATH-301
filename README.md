# AMATH-301

A repo of works for my Applied Math 301 Class @ UW

Upon completion of this course, students will be able to:

Construct and manipulate vectors and matrices in Matlab
	Solve linear systems in a variety of different contexts
	Interpolate and analyze data
	Solve nonlinear problems and optimization challenges
	Compute numerical derivatives and integrals
	Solve differential equations
	Identify and discuss key features of chaos theory and nonlinear differential equations
	Understand and use modern scientific computing tools such as principal component analysis or the fast Fourier transform
These techniques will be invaluable for future studies in applied mathematics, computer science, engineering, and other sciences.
